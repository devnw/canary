# Requirements Gap Analysis

## Claimed Requirements

List requirements that are fully implemented and verified:

(No requirements currently at TESTED or BENCHED status)

## In Progress

Requirements with STATUS=IMPL (implemented but not yet tested):

- CBIN-104 through CBIN-131 - Various CLI commands and features

## Gaps

Planned or needed work:

- Add tests for all IMPL-status requirements to promote to TESTED
- Add benchmarks for performance-critical features to promote to BENCHED

## Verification

Run verification with project filter:

```bash
canary scan --root . --verify GAP_ANALYSIS.md --project-only
```

This will:
- Filter by project pattern (CBIN-1[0-4][0-9]) from .canary/project.yaml
- ✅ Verify claimed requirements are TESTED or BENCHED
- ❌ Fail with exit code 2 if claims are overclaimed
- Skip example requirements (CBIN-001, CBIN-002, etc.)
