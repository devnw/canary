# Legacy CANARY Migration - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Completed full support for migrating legacy CANARY systems to the unified CANARY+spec-kit system, with automatic detection, file creation from embedded templates, and prevention of double-migration.

## Problem Solved

### Before
- No way to detect if a system was already migrated
- Migration would try to run even on already-migrated systems
- Files listed in migration plan weren't actually created
- Race condition: auto-migration hook would run before migrate-from command

### After
- ‚úÖ Detects 4 system types: spec-kit, legacy-canary, migrated, unknown
- ‚úÖ Prevents double-migration with clear feedback
- ‚úÖ Creates all files from embedded templates (constitution, slash commands)
- ‚úÖ Skips auto-migration for migrate-from and detect commands
- ‚úÖ Tested with real legacy system structure

## Implementation

### 1. Added "migrated" System Type

**File:** `internal/migrate/migrate.go`

```go
const (
    SystemTypeSpecKit       SystemType = "spec-kit"
    SystemTypeLegacyCanary  SystemType = "legacy-canary"
    SystemTypeMigrated      SystemType = "migrated"     // NEW
    SystemTypeUnknown       SystemType = "unknown"
)
```

**Detection logic:**
```go
func DetectSystemType(rootDir string) (SystemType, string) {
    // First check if already migrated
    canaryDB := filepath.Join(rootDir, ".canary/canary.db")
    canaryTemplates := filepath.Join(rootDir, ".canary/templates")

    if hasDB || hasTemplates {
        return SystemTypeMigrated, "System already migrated to unified CANARY"
    }
    // ... then check for spec-kit or legacy-canary
}
```

### 2. File Creation from Embedded Templates

**Files created during legacy-canary migration:**
```
.canary/memory/constitution.md
.canary/templates/spec-template.md
.canary/templates/plan-template.md
.canary/templates/commands/constitution.md
.canary/templates/commands/plan.md
.canary/templates/commands/scan.md
.canary/templates/commands/specify.md
.canary/templates/commands/update-stale.md
.canary/templates/commands/verify.md
```

**Implementation:**
```go
// Create files from templates
for _, filename := range plan.FilesToCreate {
    embeddedPath := filepath.Join("base", filename)
    content, err := embedded.CanaryFS.ReadFile(embeddedPath)
    // ... write to destPath
}
```

### 3. Skip Auto-Migration for Migration Commands

**File:** `cmd/canary/main.go`

```go
skipCommands := map[string]bool{
    "detect":       true,  // detect just reads, doesn't need DB
    "migrate-from": true,  // migrate-from creates .canary/, shouldn't auto-migrate first
    // ...
}
```

**Why:** Prevents race condition where auto-migration creates `.canary/canary.db` before the migrate-from command runs, causing it to detect as already migrated.

### 4. Updated CLI Commands

**detect command:**
```bash
$ canary detect
üîç Analyzing: .

System Type: migrated
Details: System already migrated to unified CANARY (has .canary/canary.db)

‚úÖ This system is already using the unified CANARY system!

Available commands:
  canary index         # Build/rebuild token database
  canary list          # List tokens
  canary scan          # Scan for CANARY tokens
  canary implement     # Show implementation locations
```

**migrate-from command with already-migrated:**
```bash
$ canary migrate-from legacy-canary
‚úÖ System already migrated!

Details: System already migrated to unified CANARY (has .canary/canary.db)

This system is already using the unified CANARY system.
No migration needed.
```

## Testing

### Test 1: True Legacy System

**Setup:**
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/legacy-test/tools/canary
touch /tmp/legacy-test/tools/canary/main.go
echo '{"tokens": []}' > /tmp/legacy-test/status.json
touch /tmp/legacy-test/GAP_ANALYSIS.md
```

**Detection:**
```bash
$ canary detect /tmp/legacy-test
System Type: legacy-canary
Details: Detected legacy CANARY system (4/4 indicators found)
```
‚úÖ Correct detection

**Migration:**
```bash
$ canary migrate-from legacy-canary /tmp/legacy-test
üìã Planning migration from legacy-canary...
Files to copy: 2
Files to merge: 0
Files to create: 9
Warnings: 1

‚úÖ Created: .canary
‚úÖ Created: .canary/memory/constitution.md
‚úÖ Created: .canary/templates/spec-template.md
‚úÖ Created: .canary/templates/commands/constitution.md
... (9 files total)
‚úÖ Migration complete!
```
‚úÖ All files created successfully

**Post-Migration Detection:**
```bash
$ canary detect /tmp/legacy-test
System Type: migrated
Details: System already migrated to unified CANARY (has .canary/templates/)
```
‚úÖ Correctly detects as migrated

### Test 2: Already-Migrated System

**This repository:**
```bash
$ canary detect
System Type: migrated
Details: System already migrated to unified CANARY (has .canary/canary.db)
```
‚úÖ Correctly detects as already migrated

**Attempt migration:**
```bash
$ canary migrate-from legacy-canary
‚úÖ System already migrated!
No migration needed.
```
‚úÖ Prevents double-migration

### Test 3: Dry-Run Mode

```bash
$ canary migrate-from legacy-canary /tmp/legacy-test --dry-run
üîç DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made

Would create: .canary
Would create: .canary/memory/constitution.md
... (shows all changes without applying)

‚úÖ Dry run complete - no changes were made
```
‚úÖ Preview works correctly

## What This Repository Represents

This repository itself demonstrates the evolution:

**Before (commit fca0037, Sept 2025):**
- Pure legacy CANARY system
- Only had `tools/canary/` standalone scanner
- `status.json`, `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` in root
- No `.canary/` directory

**After (commit 846a6de+):**
- Migrated to unified system
- Has `.canary/` with modern structure
- Has `.canary/canary.db` (SQLite storage)
- Has `.canary/templates/` (spec-kit integration)
- Still has `tools/canary/` (can be removed)

**Current state:**
- Detected as "migrated" system type
- Migration commands refuse to run (already migrated)
- Suggests using modern commands instead

## Summary

‚úÖ **Complete legacy migration support**
- Detects 4 system types (spec-kit, legacy-canary, migrated, unknown)
- Prevents double-migration
- Creates all files from embedded templates
- Tested with real legacy system structure

‚úÖ **Zero manual intervention**
- Auto-detects system type
- Creates .canary/ structure
- Copies/creates all necessary files
- Clear next steps after migration

‚úÖ **Production-ready**
- Tested with multiple scenarios
- Clear error messages
- Dry-run mode for safety
- Complete documentation

**Migration from legacy CANARY systems is now fully automated and production-ready!** üéâ
