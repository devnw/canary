# Requirements Gap Analysis (Self)

## Claimed Requirements

List requirements that are fully implemented and verified:

✅ CBIN-101
✅ CBIN-102

## Gaps

List requirements that are planned or in progress:

- [ ] CBIN-111 - ScanCmd (STATUS=IMPL, needs tests)
- [ ] CBIN-124 - IndexCmd (STATUS=IMPL, needs tests)
- [ ] CBIN-125 - ListCmd (STATUS=IMPL, needs tests)
- [ ] CBIN-134 - SpecModification (STATUS=IMPL, needs integration tests)

## Verification

Run verification with:

```bash
canary scan --root . --verify GAP_ANALYSIS.md
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify claimed requirements are TESTED or BENCHED
- ❌ Fail with exit code 2 if claims are overclaimed
