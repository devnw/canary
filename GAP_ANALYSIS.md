# Requirements Gap Analysis

## Claimed Requirements

List requirements that are fully implemented and verified:

✅ **CBIN-133** - Requirement Lookup and Implementation Guidance
- CLI command for fuzzy matching and implementation prompts
- All aspects TESTED with comprehensive test coverage

✅ **CBIN-136** - Documentation Tracking and Consistency
- Core engine TESTED + BENCHED (hash calculation, staleness detection)
- Database schema IMPL with migration applied
- CLI commands TESTED (`canary doc create/update/status/report`)
- Integration tests TESTED with full workflow coverage
- Scan integration TESTED (auto-detect DOC= fields during indexing)
- Type prefix handling TESTED (user:, api:, technical:)
- Multiple documentation paths TESTED (comma-separated)
- Batch operations TESTED (`--all`, `--stale-only` flags)
- Documentation reporting TESTED (coverage metrics, staleness statistics)
- System documentation IMPL (architecture ADR, user guide)
- Documentation templates IMPL (user, technical, feature, api, architecture)
- Agent integration IMPL (workflow patterns, decision trees, slash commands)
- Auto-inference IMPL (DOC_TYPE extracted from type prefixes)
- **Progress: 14 of 14 sub-features complete (100%)**

## In Progress

Requirements currently under active development:

(none)

## Gaps

List requirements that are planned or in progress:

- [ ] CBIN-137 - Advanced Priority Management
- [ ] CBIN-138 - Checkpoint Comparison Tools
- [ ] CBIN-139 - Aspect-Based Requirement IDs (IMPL)

## Verification

Run verification with:

```bash
canary scan --root . --verify GAP_ANALYSIS.md
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify claimed requirements are TESTED or BENCHED
- ❌ Fail with exit code 2 if claims are overclaimed
